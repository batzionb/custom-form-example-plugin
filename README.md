# Custom Form Plugin Example

This repository demonstrates a Backstage plugin designed to customize and extend the workflow execution form. It provides a standalone Backstage instance for debugging and testing the plugin prior to integration with the orchestrator in a Red Hat Developer Hub deployment. The pluginâ€™s customized features are showcased in conjunction with the [example workflow](https://github.com/parodos-dev/serverless-workflows-config/tree/main/charts/extendable-workflow). The input schema for this workflow includes custom UI properties that activate specific form enhancements. For instance, the property ["ui:widget": "CountryWidget"](https://github.com/parodos-dev/serverless-workflows-config/blob/main/charts/extendable-workflow/templates/02-configmap_01-extendable-workflow-resources-schemas.yaml#L24) directs the form to load the custom CountryWidget component provided by this plugin.
